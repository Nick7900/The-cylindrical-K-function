# The-cylindrical-K-function
Demonstration to run the cylindrical-K-function code with pictures. The code analyses the point patterns of linear structures to identify anisotropy with a cylinder structuring element. The script is based on article '[The cylindrical K-function and Poisson line cluster point processe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07423)' by Jesper MÃ¸ller. 

All credits go to the script writer, Ninna Vihrs.
